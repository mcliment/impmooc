					<h2>Type and usage of important studio cables</h2>
					<p>

				<section>
					<h2>Who am I?</h2>
					<p>I'm Marc Climent, a Software Developer living in Valencia, Spain.</p>
					<p class="odd">Interested in music and sound as a hobby, maybe just like you.</p>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Common connectors</h2>
					<p>These are the most common connectors you can find in a music studio. We'll see them in detail.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>TS - "Tip-Sleeve"</li>
						<li>TRS - "Tip-Ring-Sleeve"</li>
						<li>XLR</li>
						<li>RCA</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>TS - "Tip sleeve"</h2>
					<p>A very basic connector. Mostly used to connect <strong>mono instruments like guitars</strong>. It's also known as <strong>audio jack</strong>.<p>
					<p class="odd">The cables contain <strong>two connectors</strong>, one for the sound information (or live) and the other for ground.</p>
					<p>The <strong>tip</strong> is connected to the live conductor and the <strong>sleeve</strong> is connected to the ground conductor.</p>
					<p class="odd">As there's only one conductor for sound, it's unbalanced, so it should <strong>only be used in short distances</strong> and only if necessary because significant noise can appear.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>TRS - "Tip Ring sleeve"</h2>
					<p>An enhancement of the TS connector. Mostly used to connect <strong>stereo headphones</strong> (stereo jack) as well as creating <strong>balanced mono connections</strong>.</p>
					<p class="odd">The cables contain <strong>three connectors</strong>, two for the sound information and the other for ground.</p>
					<p>The <strong>tip</strong> and the <strong>ring</strong> are connected to the live conductors and the <strong>sleeve</strong> is connected to the ground conductor.</p>
					<p class="odd">If used for balanced connections, protection against noise is provided and reach distances of <strong>several meters</strong> without noise problems (seen later).</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>TS vs TRS</h2>
					<img src="img/tsvstrs.png" width="400" height="365" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>TS and TRS</h2>
					<p>As you can see, it's difficult to know if a connector hole is for TS or TRS cables</p>
					<p class="odd">TS are usually connected to <strong>Instrument (or Instr) or HiZ</strong> labeled connections</p>
					<p>TRS are usually connected to <strong>Phones</strong> labeled connections.</p>
					<p class="odd">TRS is used mostly in any other type of application.</p>
					<p>There are also small versions of these connectors or <strong>mini jacks</strong> used commonly for headphones and many other consumer products.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>XLR</h2>
					<p>The name comes from a product called Cannon X (there the X). Then a latch was added (there the L). And finally the R comes from the material that surrounded the female connector. Therefore are also known as <strong>Cannon connectors</strong>.</p>
					<p class="odd">They are commonly used for connecting <strong>microphones</strong> and have many other applications as they are balanced and keep fixed together when connected.</p>
					<p>The cable has three conductors and works like the TRS cable, with two conductors carrying the audio signals and the other the ground signal.</p>
					<p class="odd"><strong>Phantom power</strong> can be provided with this cable with 40V DC in both carrier conductors using the ground as reference</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>XLR</h2>
					<p>The XLR connector</p>
					<img src="img/xlr.png" width="600" height="353" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>RCA</h2>
					<p>The name comes from Radio Corporation of America.</p>
					<p class="odd">Usually come two (red and white) or three (<strong>red, white and yellow</strong>) connectors together with a two conductor cable each.</p>
					<p><span style="color: white;">White</span> is for left or mono channel, <span style="color: red;">Red</span> for right stereo channel and <span style="color: yellow;">Yellow</span> is used for video</p>
					<p class="odd">They are commonly used to connect end user equipment like TVs or DVDs.</p>
					<p>As with TS, they are not balanced so noise is expected with long distances. Keep them short.</p>

					<h2>XLR</h2>
					<p>The XLR connector</p>
					<img src="img/rca.png" width="600" height="353" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Balanced connections</h2>
					<p>The two conductors that carry the sound in balanced connections are <strong>twisted</strong> ant thus they suffer the same <strong>interferences</strong> from external sources.</p>
					<p class="odd">The trick is that the signal from one cable has the <strong>phase inverted</strong> from the other, this means that the signal is inverse (if added it should be nothing).</p>
					<p>What happens if <strong>noise is affects equally</strong> both conductors? It doubles when added! This way, the noise can be <em>extracted</em> and removed from the audio signal.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Balanced connections</h2>
					<p>Awesome!</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>But...</h2>
					<p>Yes, guitars have TS cables and you can't change that.</p>
					<p class="odd">The solution: a DI Box.</p>
					<p><img src="img/di-box.png" width="600" height="137" /></p>
					<small>Behringer ULTRA-DI DI100</small>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>DI Box</h2>
					<p>DI comes from <strong>Direct Inject</strong>.</p>
					<p class="odd">They convert HiZ or High Impedance unbalanced signals to Low Impedance microphone balanced signals.</p>
					<p>They are small and portable. Some of them are passive, others need a small battery.</p>
					<p class="odd">It's better to have a short TS cable from the instrument, use a DI box to carry the sound anywhere.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>Each cable has its own use. They are not perfect but it's better to know their strengths and weaknesses!</p>
					<p class="odd">Balance your signals as soon as possible if you want them to go somewhere.</p>
					<p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
